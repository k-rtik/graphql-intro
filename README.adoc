== What you'll learn

You'll learn how to create and test a microservice using MicroProfile GraphQL and Open Liberty.
You'll use Maven throughout the guide to build the microservice and deploy it
to run on the Open Liberty application server.

=== What is GraphQL
GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling these queries with
existing data.

GraphQL queries specify the shape of the response data, which allows users to get exactly what data they want.
GraphQL APIs contain a single endpoint that handles queries. GraphQL APIs are defined by Types and Fields as opposed
to being defined by endpoints like REST APIs. This enables GraphQL APIs to operate on multiple resources in the single
query where REST APIs would require loading the data from multiple URLs.

You will create a GraphQL web service that queries, manipulates and stores album and artist information.
The artist and album resources are provided in JSON files.

//--** Describe what user should run and expect to see after running the complete version of the application.
You are provided with Graphiql, an interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE, which is served by the Open Liberty server.
You can use Graphiql to perform queries in with an interactive interface to assist in development and testing of the API.

Once the server is running, access {graphiql-url}[{graphiql-url}^].
Run the following query to get the artist data for Drake:

=== Enabling GraphQL

The MicroProfile GraphQL feature enables GraphQL support for your application.
This feature is already enabled in the [hotspot=graphQLFeature]`configuration file`.

=== Creating the GraphQL API

In GraphQL, a single class should represent a single resource, or a group of resources of the same type.
In this application, artists and albums are the two resources. Since the two resources are related, they can be
represented by a single class.

The `start` folder already contains the data files, [hotspot file=2]`artists.json` and [hotspot file=3]`albums.json`,
and their respective model classes, [hotspot file=4]`Album` and [hotspot file=5]`Artist`.
The `start` folder also contains [hotspot file=1]`JsonService`, a static class to deserialize the artist and album data from data files
into the model classes.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `ArtistService` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/ArtistService.java`
----

The [hotspot=graphQLApi file=0]`@GraphQLApi` annotation indicates that `ArtistService` is a GraphQL endpoint.
Methods in this class can define GraphQL queries and annotations.

Entities are the objects used in GraphQL. An entity is created in the schema from a custom Java class when the class is
used as the return type or argument of a query or mutation method, or the return type of a method that has a
`@Source` annotation applied on an argument.

Queries are GraphQL requests that request all or specific fields of an object.
A GraphQL query is created in the schema for any method in `ArtistService` annotated with
[hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtist hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtists file=0]`@Query`.
The value parameter of the [hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtist hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtists file=0]`@Query` annotation
is used for the name of the GraphQL query.
If the value parameter is not provided, the method's name is used as the query's name.

Mutations are GraphQL requests that modify a resource.
A GraphQL mutation is created in the schema for any method in `ArtistService` annotated with
[hotspot=mutationAnnotationAddArtist hotspot=mutationAnnotationReset file=0]`@Mutation`.
Similar to [hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtist hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtists file=0]`@Query`, the value parameter of
the [hotspot=mutationAnnotationAddArtist hotspot=mutationAnnotationReset file=0]`@Mutation` annotation is used for the
name of the GraphQL mutation.
If the value parameter is not provided, the method's name is used as the query's name.

The value parameter of the
[hotspot=nameAnnotationGetArtist hotspot=nameAnnotationGetArtists hotspot=nameAnnotationAddArtist file=0]`@Name` annotation
is used for the name of the GraphQL query or mutation parameter.
If the value parameter is not provided, the method argument's name is used as the the query parameter's name.

The [hotspot=nameAnnotationAlbum file=5]`@Name` annotation can also be used to change the name of an attribute used in a
class that represents a GraphQL entity.
The value parameter of the [hotspot=nameAnnotationAlbum file=5]`@Name` annotation is used for the field name in the
corresponding GraphQL entity.

=== Queries

The `ArtistService` class contains two queries, [hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtist]`artist` and
[hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtists]`artists`.

The [hotspot=getArtist]`getArtist()` method implements the [hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtist file=0]`artist`
query, which retrieves the artist corresponding to the name supplied by the argument
[hotspot=nameAnnotationGetArtist]`name`.
When an artist is not found, a [hotspot=graphQlExceptionGetArtist]`GraphQLException` is thrown, which returns
an `error` object to the client.

The [hotspot=getArtists]`getArtists()` method implements the [hotspot=queryAnnotationGetArtists]`artists`
query, which retrieves a list of artists corresponding to the list of artist names supplied by the
[hotspot=nameAnnotationGetArtists]`names` argument.
When artists in the list of names are not found, a [hotspot=graphQlExceptionGetArtists]`GraphQLException`
is thrown, which returns an `error` object containing the missing names to the client.

The [hotspot=getArtists]`getArtists()` method gets all possible results instead of throwing a `GraphQLException`
on the first unknown artist.
Since GraphQL handles partial results when an error occurs, the found artist objects are returned to the client
alongside the error when [hotspot=graphQlExceptionGetArtists]`GraphQLException` is thrown.

ArtistService.java
[source,java,linenums,role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/ArtistService.java[]
----

=== Mutations

The `ArtistService` class contains two mutations,
[hotspot=mutationAnnotationAddArtist hotspot=nameAnnotationAddArtist file=0]`addArtist` and
[hotspot=mutationAnnotationReset hotspot=methodSignatureReset file=0]`reset`.

The [hotspot=addArtist file=0]`addArtist()` method implements the
[hotspot=mutationAnnotationAddArtist hotspot=nameAnnotationAddArtist file=0]`addArtist` mutation, which adds a new artist
to the service.
If an artist with the same name already exists in the service, the [hotspot=addArtist file=0]`addArtist()` method throws
a [hotspot=graphQlExceptionArtistExists hotspot=graphQlExceptionAddArtist file=0]`GraphQLException`.

The artist to add to the service is passed to the
[hotspot=mutationAnnotationAddArtist hotspot=nameAnnotationAddArtist file=0]`addArtist` query through the
[hotspot=nameAnnotationAddArtist file=0]`artist` argument.
When the entity passed to the artist parameter does not contain an attribute in the [hotspot=attributes file=1]`Artist`
or [hotspot=attributes file=2]`Album` class
the value is set as `null`.

When the `@NotNull` annotation is used on an attribute in the [hotspot=notNull file=1]`Artist` and
[hotspot=notNull file=2]`Album` class, an error is thrown when the entity passed to the
[hotspot=nameAnnotationAddArtist file=0]`artist` parameter of
[hotspot=mutationAnnotationAddArtist hotspot=nameAnnotationAddArtist file=0]`addArtist` does not contain that field or
if the value of the field is `null`.

The [hotspot=reset file=0]`reset()` method implements the
[hotspot=mutationAnnotationReset hotspot=methodSignatureReset file=0]`reset` mutation, which resets the data handled by
the service to the data deserialized from the JSON data files.
This method returns the number of artists removed from the service when the data is reset.

=== Extending the Artist entity

The [hotspot=signatureAlbumCount]`artist` argument (of type `Artist`) of  the
[hotspot=albumCount]`albumCount()` method is annotated with [hotspot=signatureAlbumCount]`@Source`.
Since the type `Artist` is returned by a GraphQL query, the [hotspot=signatureAlbumCount]`@Source` annotation
adds the name of the method, `albumCount` as a property to the `Artist` GraphQL entity.

== Running the application

[role='command']
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/master/devmode-build.adoc[]

Access {schema-url}[{schema-url}^] to view the API schema.

The schema for this API looks like:

[role='no_copy']
----
type Album {
  ntracks: Int!
  title: String!
  year: String!
}

type Artist {
  albumCount: Int!
  albums: [Album]
  genres: String!
  name: String!
}

"Mutation root"
type Mutation {
  addArtist(artist: ArtistInput): Boolean!
  reset: Int!
}

"Query root"
type Query {
  artist(name: String): Artist
  artists(artists: [String]): [Artist]
}

input AlbumInput {
  ntracks: Int!
  title: String!
  year: String!
}

input ArtistInput {
  albums: [AlbumInput]
  genres: String!
  name: String!
}
----

The `!` in the schema indicates that the field of an entity (type or input), or the return value of a mutation, is
not `null`.

Notice that the schema lists `albumCount: Int!` as part of the type Artist, but `albumCount` is not an attribute of the
 [hotspot=attributes file=1]`Artist` class.
The [hotspot=signatureAlbumCount file=0]`@Source` annotation applied on the [hotspot=signatureAlbumCount file=0]`artist`
argument of [hotspot=albumCount file=0]`albumCount()` associates the return value of the method, an integer, to the
`albumCount` field of the GraphQL type Artist.

Access {graphiql-url}[{graphiql-url}^] to open Graphiql.

When you run a GraphQL query, you are required to specify the properties you want for an entity. The result object
has only the specified properties.

Run the following query to request the name and number of albums of The Beatles stored in `ArtistService`,
and the titles of their albums:

[role='command']
----
query {
  artist(name: "The Beatles") {
    name
    albumCount
    albums {
      title
    }
  }
}
----

Run the following query to request the name and title of albums of multiple artists, including an artist that does not
exist:

[role='command']
----
query {
  artists(names: ["Unknown", "Billie Holiday"]) {
    name
    albums {
      title
    }
  }
}
----

Notice that the result of the query contains both the error for the unknown artist and the partial results for the
query, which contains the artist objects for the artists that exist.

The above query can only get the same fields from multiple artist entities. Since GraphQL can support multiple queries
in a single request, you can get different fields for multiple artist entities by running the following request:

[role='command']
----
query {
  BillieHoliday: artist(name: "Billie Holiday") {
    name
    genres
  }
  Unknown: artist(name: "Unknown") {
    name
  }
  Drake: artist(name: "Drake") {
    name
    albumCount
  }
}
----

Similar to the [hotspot=getArtists file=0]`artists` query, this request also contains an error object for the unknown
artist "Unknown", and results for the other artists with different fields in each object.

Run the [hotspot=addArtist file=0]`addArtist` mutation to add a new artist to `ArtistService`.
Attempting to add an artist whose name already exists in the service results in an error.
Since all attributes of the [hotspot=notNull file=1]`Artist` and [hotspot=notNull file=2]`Album` classes are annotated
with `@NotNull`, omitting a field or setting it to `null` in the input `artist` for the following mutation will also
result in an error.

[role='command']
----
mutation {
  addArtist(artist: {
    name: "Adele",
    genres: "Pop",
    albums: [
      {
        title: "19"
        ntracks: 12
        year: "2008"
      },
      {
        title: "21"
        ntracks: 11
        year: "2011"
      },
      {
        title: "25"
        ntracks: 11
        year: "2015"
      }
    ]
  })
}

== Testing the application

You can test this service manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at the
{graphiql-url}[{graphiql-url}^] URL.
Automated tests are a much better approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug.
JUnit and the SmallRye GraphQL Client provide a simple environment to test the application.

=== Creating the GraphQL API client interface

The GraphQL Client API and its implementation are included as dependencies specified in your
[hotspot=clientDependencies file=2]`pom.xml` file.
Look for the dependencies with the [hotspot=graphQlClientApiDependency file=2]`smallrye-graphql-client-api` and
[hotspot=graphQlClientDependency file=2]`smallrye-graphql-client` artifact IDs.

These dependencies provides the library that is required to implement the GraphQL Rest Client interface.

The GraphQL client API uses template interface to describe the remote service that you want to access.
The interface defines the queries and mutations to access as a method by mapping its annotations, return type and list
of arguments.

Since GraphQL requires that the required fields for an entity be sent with the query, the GraphQL client derives the
required fields from the attributes of the return type.
If the GraphQL client interface has a method annotated with `@Query` that maps the `artist` query and returns an
instance of the `Artist` class, the following query is requested from the GraphQL API:

[role='no_copy']
----
query {
  artist(name: ...) {
    name
    genres
    albums {
      title
      ntracks
      year
    }
  }
}
----

For the GraphQL client to query an artist with the `albumCount` field, you need to create a class that extends the
`Artist` class and contains the `albumCount` attribute.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `ArtistWithAlbumCount` class.#
`src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/graphql/client/models/ArtistService.java`
----

The [hotspot=artistWithAlbumCount file=0]`ArtistWithAlbumCount` class extends the [hotspot=extends file=0]`Artist` class
and contains the attribute [hotspot=albumCount file=0]`albumCount` that is annotated with
[hotspot=albumCount file=0]`@NotNull`.
If the GraphQL client interface has a method annotated with `@Query` that returns an instance of the
`ArtistWithAlbumCount` class, the following fields are requested from the GraphQL API:

[role='no_copy']
----
query {
  artist(name: ...) {
    name
    genres
    albumCount
    albums {
      title
      ntracks
      year
    }
  }
}
----

If you require a different subset of fields from the artist entity, you should create another class that maps to the
required fields.

Next, create a GraphQL client interface for the system service.
Write a template interface that maps the API of the artist service.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `ArtistServiceAPI` class.#
`src/test/java/io/openliberty/graphql/client/ArtistServiceAPI.java`
----

The [hotspot=artistServiceApi file=1]`ArtistServiceAPI` interface contains two methods annotated with
`@Mutation`, the [hotspot=addArtist file=1]`addArtist()` method that maps to the `addArtist` mutation and the
[hotspot=reset file=1]`reset()` method that maps to the `reset` mutation.

The [hotspot=artistServiceApi file=1]`interface` contains four methods annotated with `@Query`.
The `artist` query is modeled by the [hotspot=getArtist file=1]`getArtist()` method which returns an artist object that
does not contain the `albumCount` field, and the [hotspot=getArtistWithAlbumCount file=1]`getArtistWithAlbumCount()` method
which returns an artist object that contains the `albumCount` field. Similarly, the `artists` query is modeled by
the [hotspot=getArtists file=1]`getArtists()` method and the
[hotspot=getArtistsWithAlbumCount file=1]`getArtistsWithAlbumCount()` method.
The [hotspot=getArtists file=1]`getArtists()` method returns artist objects that do not contain the `albumCount` field
and the [hotspot=getArtistsWithAlbumCount file=1]`getArtistsWithAlbumCount()` method returns artist objects that
contain the `albumCount` field.

=== Creating the test class

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `ArtistServiceIT` class.#
`src/test/java/io/openliberty/graphql/ArtistServiceIT.java`
----

The [hotspot=verifyArtist]`verifyArtist()` and [hotspot=verifyAlbums]`verifyAlbums()` helper methods test the equality
of the expected `Artist` and `Album` objects and the objects returned by the GraphQL API.
The test methods, annotated with
[hotspot=testAnnotationTestGetArtist hotspot=testAnnotationTestGetUnknownArtist hotspot=testAnnotationTestGetArtists hotspot=testAnnotationTestGetArtistWithAlbumCount hotspot=testAnnotationTestAddArtistMutation hotspot=testAnnotationTestResetMutation]`@Test`,
use the GraphQL client to test a query/mutation in the GraphQL API.
The [hotspot=setupClientAndArtists]`setupClientAndArtists()` method resets the `ArtistService` service, gets the expected
`Artist` and `Album` objects and builds the GraphQL client.
This method is executed once before running the tests.

The [hotspot=getArtist]`testGetArtist()` test method executes the `artist` query on a single artist and verifies that
the correct object is returned.

The [hotspot=getUnknownArtist]`testGetUnknownArtist()` test method executes the `artist` query on a nonexistent artist
and verifies that a `GraphQLException` is triggered.

The [hotspot=getArtists]`testGetArtists()` test method executes the `artists` query and verifies that all the returned
objects are correct.

The [hotspot=getArtistWithAlbumCount]`testGetArtistWithAlbumCount()` test method executes the `artist` query. The query
is requested with the `albumCount` field by using the `getArtistWithAlbumCount()` method in the client which returns an
`ArtistWithAlbumCount` object.
This test method verifies that the correct object is returned and that the object has the correct album count.

The [hotspot=addArtistMutation]`testAddArtistMutation()` test method executes the `addArtist` mutation to add a new artist
to the service.
It uses the `artist` query to request the newly added artist and verifies that the correct artist object is returned,
with the correct value for `albumCount`.

The [hotspot=resetMutation]`testResetMutation()` test method executes the `reset` mutation and verifies that the number
of deleted artists from the service is 1, since we added one new artist to the service.
