NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form,
view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Explore how to create a GraphQL web service and consume a GraphQL web service using template interfaces.

:graphiql-url: http://localhost:9080/api/graphiql.html
:schema-url: http://localhost:9080/api/graphql/schema.graphql

== What you'll learn

You'll learn how to create and test a microservice using MicroProfile GraphQL and Open Liberty.
You'll use Maven throughout the guide to build the microservice and deploy it
to run on the Open Liberty application server.

=== What is GraphQL
GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling these queries with
existing data.

GraphQL queries specify the shape of the response data, which allows users to get exactly what data they want.
GraphQL APIs contain a single endpoint that handles queries. GraphQL APIs are defined by Types and Fields as opposed
to being defined by endpoints like REST APIs. This enables GraphQL APIs to operate on multiple resources in the single
query where REST APIs would require loading the data from multiple URLs.

You will create a GraphQL web service that queries, manipulates and stores album and artist information.
The artist and album resources are provided in JSON files.

///////////////////////////
// Getting started

///////////////////////////
// Try what youâ€™ll build
///////////////////////////

[role='command']
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/master/twyb-intro.adoc[]

//--** Describe what user should run and expect to see after running the complete version of the application.
You are provided with Graphiql, an interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE, which is served by the Open Liberty server.
You can use Graphiql to perform queries in with an interactive interface to assist in development and testing of the API.

Once the server is running, access {graphiql-url}[{graphiql-url}^].
Run the following query to get the artist data for Drake:

[role='command']
----
query {
    artist(artist: "Drake") {
        name
        genres
        albums {
            title
            year
            ntracks
        }
    }
}
----

The response returned by the API is:

[role='no_copy']
----
{
  "data": {
    "artist": {
      "name": "Drake",
      "genres": "Hip Hop",
      "albums": [
        {
          "title": "Thank Me Later",
          "year": "2010",
          "ntracks": 14
        },
        {
          "title": "Take Care",
          "year": "2011",
          "ntracks": 18
        },
        {
          "title": "Nothing Was the Same",
          "year": "2013",
          "ntracks": 13
        },
        {
          "title": "Views",
          "year": "2016",
          "ntracks": 20
        },
        {
          "title": "Scorpion",
          "year": "2018",
          "ntracks": 25
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

The query must always specify the required fields and only those fields are returned by the API.
Run the following query to request only the `name` and `genres` field of artists Drake and Rihanna.

[role='command']
----
query {
    artist(artist: "Drake") {
        name
        genres
        albums {
            title
            year
            ntracks
        }
    }
}
----

The response returned by the API is:

[role='no_copy']
----
query {
  artists(artists: ["Drake", "Rihanna"]) {
    name
    genres
  }
}
----

Access {schema-url}[{schema-url}^] to view the API schema.
The API schema is:

[role='no_copy']
----
type Album {
  ntracks: Int!
  title: String
  year: String
}

type Artist {
  albumCount: Int!
  albums: [Album]!
  genres: String!
  name: String!
}

"Mutation root"
type Mutation {
  addArtist(artist: ArtistInput): Boolean!
  reset: Int!
}

"Query root"
type Query {
  artist(name: String): Artist
  artists(artists: [String]): [Artist]
}

input AlbumInput {
  ntracks: Int!
  title: String
  year: String
}

input ArtistInput {
  albums: [AlbumInput]!
  genres: String!
  name: String!
}
----
The `!` beside the type of a field indicates that its value cannot be null.

== Section title for this section, starting with a gerund like Creating, Building, etc

//--** Add the various sections that are needed for a particular guide.

//--** Start each additional section title with a meaningful gerund such as Creating, Building, Testing.
//--** Follow the gerund with a meaningful noun phrase. For example: Creating a JAX-RS application
//--** Have as many sections and section titles as needed.
// EXAMPLES:

* Building a todo list model

* Creating an application manager

* Creating the JAX-RS Resource


//--** Write a sentence with the context like "Navigate to the `start` directory to begin." in the section
//--** where user starts working with the implementation.

//--** Add the include adoc for starting the Open Liberty server in development mode,
//--** so that the server automatically picks up any changes that the users make to their application.

//--** You can instruct the user to "Create", "Update", or "Replace" files in their application.

//--** Note: There are classes that depend on each other. If one of the classes is not yet created
//--** in the `start` directory, but it's being referenced in a different class, development mode might exit with a compilation error.
//--** So be aware that you might need to predefine a minimal version of that class so that development mode does not exit with an error.

//--** What to add for each section:
//--** Start each section with a meaningful description about what the user is doing in the section.
//--** Include code snippets.
//--** Avoid making all the documentation a series of steps and tasks, bullets, or numbered lists.
//--** Use tick marks around directories, files, values, class names, method names, and so on.
//--** Example: `this-is-a-file`, `this/is/a/path`, `thisIsAMethod`.



// EXAMPLE: The following block demonstrates how different sections look like for a todo application.
// ======================================================================================================
== EXAMPLE: Building a todo list model

* Navigate to the `start` directory

[role='command']
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/master/devmode-start.adoc[]

* Represent an entry in a todo list

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoModel` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/models/TodoModel.java`
----

TodoModel.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
link:finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/models/TodoModel.java[]
----

* Getters, setters, and default constructor such that the model can be serialized/deserialized easily

== EXAMPLE: Creating an application manager

* Create a manager that is injected into the JAX-RS resource

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoManager` interface.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/managers/TodoManager.java`
----

TodoManager.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
link:finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/TodoManager.java[]
----

* Next, create the sample todo manager class

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SampleTodoManager` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/samples/SampleTodoManager.java`
----

SampleTodoManager.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
link:finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/samples/SampleTodoManager.java[]
----

* Implemented basic CRUD ([hotspot=32-36 file=1]`Create`, [hotspot=39-44 file=1]`Read`,
[hotspot=47-57 file=1]`Update`, and [hotspot=60-68 file=1]`Delete`) operations.
* Manager is [hotspot=14 file=1]`ApplicationScoped`, which essentially means that it is a singleton.

== EXAMPLE: Creating the JAX-RS resource

* Description of the technology, possibly with a link to learn more.
* Use CDI to inject the todo manager into the resource

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/resources/TodoResource.java`
----

TodoResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
link:finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/resources/TodoResource.java[]
----

* The resource methods are accessible via HTTP
* Use [hotspot=27-43]`GET`, [hotspot=45-54]`POST`, [hotspot=56-71]`PUT`,
and [hotspot=73-83]`DELETE` verbs to handle reading, creating, updating,
and deleting resources
* Validate data models and send appropriate response accordingly
